        <h2>Decription</h2>
        <p>The best potatoes for French fries are soaked in a sugar solution before frying. The sugar solution has something to do with the carbohydrates and prevents the potatoes from soaking up a lot of grease, so they get crunchy.</p>
        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul><li>4 large russet potatoes</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
            <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
            <li>Optional seasonings</li></ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the potatoes and rinse them under cold water to remove excess starch. Pat them dry with a clean towel or paper towel.</li>
            <li>Cut the potatoes into evenly sized matchsticks or strips, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. You can use a sharp knife or a French fry cutter if available.</li>
            <li>Place the cut potatoes in a large bowl and cover them with cold water. Let them soak for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours. This step helps remove more starch and results in crispier fries.</li>
            <li>After soaking, drain the potatoes and lay them on a clean towel or paper towel. Gently pat them dry to remove any excess water.</li>
            <li>In a large, deep pot or Dutch oven, pour enough vegetable oil to submerge the potatoes. Heat the oil over medium-high heat to 350-375째F (175-190째C). Use a kitchen thermometer to ensure the oil reaches the correct temperature.</li>
            <li>While the oil is heating, you can prepare a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain the cooked fries.</li>
            <li>Carefully lower a batch of potatoes into the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. Fry them in batches if necessary. Cook for about 3-5 minutes or until they are lightly golden and slightly crisp.</li>
            <li>Using a slotted spoon or tongs, remove the cooked fries from the oil and place them on the prepared baking sheet to drain excess oil.</li>
            <li>Once all batches are fried, increase the heat of the oil to 375-400째F (190-205째C) for a second round of frying. Return the fries to the hot oil in batches and fry for another 2-3 minutes until they turn golden brown and are crispy.</li>
            <li>Remove the second batch of fries from the oil and place them on the paper towels to drain. While still hot, season with salt and any additional desired spices.</li>
        </ol>
