        <h2>Decription</h2>
        <p>The best potatoes for French fries are soaked in a sugar solution before frying. The sugar solution has something to do with the carbohydrates and prevents the potatoes from soaking up a lot of grease, so they get crunchy.</p>
        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul>4 large russet potatoes
            Vegetable oil (for frying)
            Salt (to taste)
            Optional seasonings</ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            Peel the potatoes and rinse them under cold water to remove excess starch. Pat them dry with a clean towel or paper towel.
            Cut the potatoes into evenly sized matchsticks or strips, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. You can use a sharp knife or a French fry cutter if available.
            Place the cut potatoes in a large bowl and cover them with cold water. Let them soak for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours. This step helps remove more starch and results in crispier fries.
            After soaking, drain the potatoes and lay them on a clean towel or paper towel. Gently pat them dry to remove any excess water.
            In a large, deep pot or Dutch oven, pour enough vegetable oil to submerge the potatoes. Heat the oil over medium-high heat to 350-375째F (175-190째C). Use a kitchen thermometer to ensure the oil reaches the correct temperature.
            While the oil is heating, you can prepare a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain the cooked fries.
            Carefully lower a batch of potatoes into the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. Fry them in batches if necessary. Cook for about 3-5 minutes or until they are lightly golden and slightly crisp.
            Using a slotted spoon or tongs, remove the cooked fries from the oil and place them on the prepared baking sheet to drain excess oil.
            Once all batches are fried, increase the heat of the oil to 375-400째F (190-205째C) for a second round of frying. Return the fries to the hot oil in batches and fry for another 2-3 minutes until they turn golden brown and are crispy.
            Remove the second batch of fries from the oil and place them on the paper towels to drain. While still hot, season with salt and any additional desired spices.
